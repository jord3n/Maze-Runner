# Maze-Runner
Built in Java, this program showcases a mouse navigating a maze. Employing an array stack, the program effectively tracks the paths already traversed. The mouse dynamically explores various paths until it successfully reaches the exit. The user can adjust the program's speed or opt for a step-by-step progression by clicking the 'step' function.
